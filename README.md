# Your-Own-Library
Build your own library in your own home. This way, you won't be rummaging through your bookshelves for hours just to see if you have a book at hand. You can add the books you have and check this when purchasing a book.
# I'll add English Language Support a soon as possible. 
I'm working my classes from school right now. If you want to add your lang support please fork project and do it. I'll accept it.
